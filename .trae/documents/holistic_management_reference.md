# Holistic Management Framework Reference

## Overview

Holistic Management is a decision-making framework that considers the social, economic, and environmental impacts of actions relative to a holistic context. It operates on the principle that the world functions in wholes, and effective management requires a holistic perspective.

## Part 1: Defining the Whole Under Management

### What is a "Whole"?
A manageable whole consists of three essential components:
1. **Decision Makers** - People directly involved in management and decision-making
2. **Resource Base** - Physical and human resources available
3. **Money** - Financial resources available or that can be generated

### Step 1: Identify Decision Makers
- Include all people making day-to-day management decisions
- Include anyone with veto power over decisions
- Be inclusive rather than exclusive
- Consider that excluding decision makers can lead to problems later

### Step 2: Define Resource Base

#### Physical Resources
- Land (including livestock and wildlife)
- Buildings, machinery, equipment
- Any assets from which you can generate revenue or derive support
- Resources need not be owned, merely available
- Keep list general, not detailed

#### Human Resources
- People who can/will influence or be influenced by management decisions
- Those without veto power but who are important to success
- Clients, customers, suppliers, advisors, neighbors, family
- Environmental groups, community organizations (for large operations)
- Be inclusive - even "adversarial" groups may be important resources

### Step 3: Identify Money Sources
- Cash on hand
- Savings accounts
- Available credit from banks, friends, family
- Crowdsourcing possibilities
- Money that could be generated from physical assets
- Keep focus on big picture, not detailed financial analysis

### Guidelines for Defining the Whole
- Keep lists brief - big-picture clarity, not great detail
- Be prepared to redefine if you realize important people were excluded
- Remember you exist within larger wholes and influence other wholes

## Part 2: Creating Your Holistic Context

The holistic context guides all decisions and actions. It has two essential components (three for organizations):

### Component 1: Statement of Purpose (Organizations Only)
- Reflects what the organization was formed to do
- Should be one to two sentences maximum
- Gets to the heart of the matter
- Example: "To provide business services, access to markets, and research information to our members"
- Revisit periodically to ensure continued relevance

### Component 2: Quality of Life Statement

Describes **how you want your life to be** within the whole you manage. Consider four areas:

#### Economic Well-Being
- Essential for meeting basic human needs
- Focus on what money provides (security, comfort) rather than "making money"
- Both the entity and individuals within it should prosper

#### Relationships
- Describe the kind of relationships that result from respectful, caring behavior
- Focus on outcomes (harmony, effective communication, teamwork) not behaviors
- Example: "We work as a team that communicates effectively, remains calm under pressure and has fun together"

#### Challenge and Growth
- What is stimulating and requires resourcefulness and creativity?
- What working environment allows you to be all you can be?

#### Purpose and Contribution
- What are we about?
- What do we want to be?
- What do we ultimately want to accomplish?
- Helps find meaning and personal relevance in the work

### Component 3: Future Resource Base Description

Describes your future resource base as it must be to sustain the desired quality of life.

#### The People (Behavior)
- How must you behave to ensure continued support from people in your resource base?
- Consider each group: customers, suppliers, family, etc.
- Think from their point of view
- Examples: honest, professional, prompt, reliable, environmentally responsible
- Include behaviors needed for relationships among decision makers

#### The Land (Environment)
- Describe how land must look far into the future
- Use the four ecosystem processes framework:
  - Water cycle
  - Mineral cycle
  - Community dynamics
  - Energy flow
- Describe how these must function in the future, not as they are now
- Even non-land managers should describe surrounding environment
- Example: "Many generations hence, our land will be healthy and rich in biological diversity. Soils will be covered throughout the year, and remain where they form. Streams will flow perennially and clear and be healthy enough to drink from. Water and mineral cycles will be maximized and energy flow optimized for all life forms."

### Guidelines for Creating Holistic Context
- All decision makers should participate in creation
- Use a trained facilitator if possible
- Write it out so all can see it
- Keep to one page or less
- Don't worry about perfection - refine over time
- Ensure words mean the same thing to everyone
- Don't prioritize ideas - nothing is more important than anything else
- Don't include actions or prejudice against future actions
- Include what you are FOR, not what you are AGAINST
- Don't refer to problems, only to what lies beyond them
- Abbreviation: "holtext" (never just "context")

## Part 3: The Seven Context Checks

Before taking any action, run it through seven checks to consider social, economic, and environmental impacts relative to your holistic context.

### 1. Cause and Effect
**Question:** "Does this action address the root cause of the problem?"

- Helps avoid actions that only suppress symptoms
- Ask "What is the cause of this?" repeatedly until you find the root cause
- For land/natural resource problems, look first to the four ecosystem processes
- If problem persists or returns, you haven't addressed the cause
- In emergencies, may proceed but only to buy time to address the cause

### 2. Weak Link
A chain fails at its weakest link. Address the weakest link first when resources are limited.

#### Social Weak Link
**Question:** "Could this action, due to prevailing attitudes or beliefs, create a weak link between us and those whose support we need?"
- Address potential weak links before taking action
- Avoid creating disagreements, conflict, or resistance that could hinder progress

#### Biological Weak Link
**Question:** "Does this action address the weakest point in the life cycle of this organism?"
- Applies when dealing with populations that are problems (too many or too few)
- Every organism has a point of greatest vulnerability in its life cycle
- Addressing this maximizes effectiveness and ensures lasting results

#### Financial Weak Link
**Question:** "Does this action address the weakest link in the chain of production?"
- Chain has three links: Resource Conversion → Product Conversion → Marketing (Money Conversion)
- Resource Conversion: Using creativity and money to convert sunlight through plants
- Product Conversion: Turning plants into marketable form (crops, livestock, wildlife)
- Marketing: Converting products into money
- Investment should address the identified weakest link for maximum profit

### 3. Marginal Reaction
**Question:** "Which action will provide the greatest return toward the goal for each additional unit of money or time invested?"

- Only applies when considering two or more actions that passed other checks
- "Biggest bang for the buck"
- Since time is finite, maximize return on every hour spent
- Always subjective - comparing actions in situations often difficult to quantify

### 4. Gross Profit Analysis
**Question:** "Which enterprises contribute the most to covering the overheads of the business?"

- Used in financial planning to select best enterprises
- Gross Profit = Income - Additional Money Spent
- Additional money = money you wouldn't spend unless undertaking the enterprise
- Compare multiple enterprises to select best combination
- Only check requiring pencil and paper
- More time-consuming but worth it for new enterprises

### 5. Energy/Money Source and Use
**Questions:** 
- "Is the energy or money to be used in this action derived from the most appropriate source in terms of our holistic context?"
- "Will the way in which the energy or money is used be in line with our holistic context?"

#### Energy Sources
- **Availability:** Unlimited (solar) vs. Limited (fossil fuels)
- **Environmental Impact:** Benign vs. Damaging vs. Potentially Damaging
- Choose more benign, unlimited sources when possible

#### Money Sources
- **Internal:** From earnings, what business/land generates (preferable)
- **External:** Banks (compound interest), government subsidies (can become addictive)
- Be wary of strings attached to external money

#### Energy/Money Uses
- **Infrastructure Building:** Buildings, machinery, fencing, trained staff (preferable)
- **Cyclical:** Money grows and energy renews with no further inputs (preferable)
- **Consumptive:** No lasting effect (acceptable if action passes other checks)
- **Addictive:** Requires repeated action with increasing frequency/cost (avoid)

### 6. Sustainability
**Question:** "If we take this action, will it lead toward or away from the future resource base described in our holistic context?"

- Considers long-term environmental and social consequences
- Ensures actions provide lasting gain - socially, environmentally, economically sound

#### Your Behavior
- Consider how people in your resource base perceive your actions
- Actions should reflect described behaviors (honest, reliable, professional)

#### The Environment
- For land managers: How will action affect the four ecosystem processes?
- For non-land managers: Consider consumption and technology use impacts
- Will it move toward or away from described future landscape?

### 7. Gut Feel
**Questions:** 
- "How do we feel about this action now?"
- "Will it lead to the quality of life we desire?"
- "Will it adversely affect the lives of others?"

- **Always done last** - builds on mental picture from other checks
- Asks how you FEEL, not what you THINK
- Based on values in quality of life statement
- May choose not to act even if action passed other checks
- May act even if action failed other checks (but work to mitigate negatives)
- Consider effects on society beyond your immediate whole
- Can only be made by decision makers who understand the values

## Part 4: The Checking Process

### Guidelines
- **Speed is essential** - checking should take minutes, not hours
- If you can't quickly answer yes/no, bypass and move to next check
- Come back to bypassed checks if needed after completing others
- Some checks won't apply to certain actions - skip them
- No rules on order except: **Gut Feel must be last**
- If addressing a problem, start with Cause and Effect

### Decision Options After Checking
If action passes most/all applicable checks: Implement with confidence
If action fails one or more checks:
1. Modify how you implement the action
2. Abandon it altogether
3. Proceed anyway, knowing you'll deal with consequences later

### Speed and Practice
- With practice, checking becomes almost second nature
- Eventually will automatically consider concepts before planning
- Even actions passing all checks may prove wrong - monitoring is critical

## Part 5: Monitoring Your Plans and Actions

### The Feedback Loop: Plan-Monitor-Control-Replan
1. **Plan** - Create your plan (assume you are wrong)
2. **Monitor** - Look for deviations from plan
3. **Control** - Correct deviations to bring back to plan
4. **Replan** - When control fails or events go beyond control

### Key Principles
- **Assume you are wrong** when trying something new affecting the environment
- Monitor **proactively** to make happen what you want (not reactively "to see what happens")
- **Continuous process** - constantly adjust to stay on track
- Ask: "If I am wrong, at what point could I get the earliest possible indication?"
- Monitor that point in the simplest way possible
- Seek indicators of change and respond to feedback quickly
- Better control = less need to replan

### Emergency Situations
- Take actions to deal with emergency
- But still check each action against holistic context while dealing with emergency
- Tendency to slip back into immediate-need decision making will always exist

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Context Checks Summary
1. **Cause and Effect:** Root cause addressed?
2. **Weak Link - Social:** Creates resistance with supporters?
3. **Weak Link - Biological:** Addresses organism's vulnerable point?
4. **Weak Link - Financial:** Strengthens weakest production link?
5. **Marginal Reaction:** Greatest return per unit invested? (comparing actions)
6. **Gross Profit Analysis:** Most contribution to overheads? (comparing enterprises)
7. **Energy/Money Source:** Appropriate source per holtext?
8. **Energy/Money Use:** Use aligns with holtext?
9. **Sustainability:** Leads toward future resource base?
10. **Gut Feel:** Feels right? Leads to desired quality of life? (ALWAYS LAST)

### Remember
- No tyranny in Holistic Management - you may choose to act despite failing checks
- Even actions passing all checks could prove wrong
- Monitoring and proactive response to deviations is essential
- The framework helps avoid unintended consequences from past management
- Focus shifts from immediate needs to conscious awareness of desired life and life-supporting environment
