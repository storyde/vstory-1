This template is built on [smwhr's dendry starter pack](https://github.com/smwhr/dendry-starter-pack), with the addition of sidebars, chat like interface and custom styles. 

Another difference is that to change the game's title and author, you'll have to change `out/html/index.html` and `out/html/game.js`, as well as `source/info.dry`.

To see what the page looks like, see 

## Editing the sidebars

See `source/scenes/info.scene.dry` and `source/scenes/holtext.scene.dry` Everything in these scenes will be displayed in the sidebars, and will be updated on every click.

## Editing the stylesheet and/or adding custom JS

See `out/html/game.css` and `out/html/game.js`.
