title: Cause and Effect Check
subtitle: Addressing Root Causes
new-page: true

Facilyn: The first context check helps you avoid treating symptoms while ignoring underlying causes by asking:

Facilyn: "Does this action address the root cause of the problem?"

Me: I need help distinguishing cause from symptom.

Facilyn: Think of it this way — symptoms are what you observe or experience, while causes are what creates those symptoms. For example, if robots keep malfunctioning, the symptom is broken robots, but the cause might be poor maintenance or inadequate training.

Facilyn: After finding a cause, you might need to ask yourself multiple times: "Well, and what is the cause of that?" to really get to the root of the problem.

A repair robot wheels past the teahouse, methodically fixing a street lamp that keeps flickering, apparently unaware that the real problem is the faulty electrical connection three blocks away.

@fqce_pass
title: Yes, it addresses the root cause
on-arrival: fltr-cause = "addresses root cause"
go-to: 24_fq_weak_link
tags: cause_effect

Me: Yes, it addresses the root cause.

Facilyn: Excellent. You've identified that your action targets the fundamental issue, not just its symptoms. This gives your decision a solid foundation.

@fqce_fail
title: No, it only treats symptoms
on-arrival: fltr-cause = "treats symptoms"
go-to: 24_fq_weak_link
tags: cause_effect

Me: No, it only treats symptoms.

Facilyn: An important realization. Treating symptoms might provide temporary relief, but the underlying problem will likely resurface. Consider how you might address the deeper cause instead.

Facilyn: If you finish the checks and still lack a clear answer, circle back here. Revisiting skipped checks often provides the missing piece of the puzzle.
