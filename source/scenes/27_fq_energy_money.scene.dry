title: Energy/Money Source Check
subtitle: Sustainable Resource Management
new-page: true

Facilyn: The next check applies to both energy and money and has two parts. 

Facilyn: The first part examines the source:

Facilyn: "Is the energy or money to be used in this action derived from the most appropriate source in terms of our holistic context?"

- #em_source

# Source

@fqem_source_explanation
title: I need help understanding this check
tags: em_source

Me: I need help understanding this check.

Facilyn: Is it unlimited/renewable/internal (appropriate) or limited/polluting/external with strings attached (inappropriate)?

- #em_source

@fqem_source_pass
title: The source is appropriate
on-arrival: em-source = "Passed"
go-to: fqem_use_intro; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_source

Me: The source is appropriate.

Facilyn: Good. Using renewable, internal, or non-damaging sources builds resilience.

@fqem_source_issues
title: There are issues with the source
on-arrival: em-source = "Failed"
go-to: fqem_use_intro; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_source

Me: There are issues with the source.

Facilyn: Noting this is important. Relying on finite or external sources with strings attached can create vulnerability.

@fqem_source_skip
title: Skip source check
on-arrival: em-source = "Skipped"
go-to: fqem_use_intro; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_source

Me: Skip source check.

# Use

@fqem_use_intro
title: Energy/Money Use Check

Facilyn: Now the second part of this filter is about the use:

Facilyn: "Will the way in which the energy or money is used be in line with our holistic context?"

- #em_use

@fqem_use_explanation
title: I need help understanding this check
tags: em_use

Me: I need help understanding this check.

Facilyn: Is it for infrastructure/cyclical (constructive) or merely consumptive/addictive (potentially destructive)?

- #em_use

@fqem_use_pass
title: The use is appropriate
on-arrival: em-use = "Passed"
go-to: 28_fq_sustainability; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_use

Me: The use is appropriate.

Facilyn: Excellent. Investing in infrastructure or cyclical growth creates lasting value.

@fqem_use_issues
title: There are issues with the use
on-arrival: em-use = "Failed"
go-to: 28_fq_sustainability; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_use

Me: There are issues with the use.

Facilyn: Be cautious. Consumptive or addictive uses can drain resources without rebuilding them.

@fqem_use_skip
title: Skip use check
on-arrival: em-use = "Skipped"
go-to: 28_fq_sustainability; jumpScene if fltr-result = "visited"
tags: em_use

Me: Skip use check.
