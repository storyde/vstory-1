title: Weak Link Checks
subtitle: Identifying Vulnerabilities
new-page: true

Facilyn: The weak link checks help you identify vulnerabilities in three different situations. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the same applies to your decisions.

Facilyn: Which type of weak link would you like to examine first with your example?

@social_weak_link
title: Social Weak Link — Relationships
on-arrival: wl-type-s = 1
tags: weak_links

Me: Social Weak Link — Relationships.

Facilyn: The social weak link question reminds you to address a potential conflict in advance:

Facilyn: "Could this action, due to prevailing attitudes or beliefs, create a weak link between us and those whose support we need?"

@biological_weak_link
title: Biological Weak Link — Organisms
on-arrival: wl-type-b = 1
tags: weak_links

Me: Biological Weak Link — Organisms.

Facilyn: The biological weak link is about addressing the greatest vulnerability when dealing with populations of plant or animal organisms:

Facilyn: "Does this action address the weakest point in the life cycle of this organism?"

@financial_weak_link
title: Financial Weak Link — Production
on-arrival: wl-type-f = 1
tags: weak_links

Me: Financial Weak Link — Production.

Facilyn: The financial weak link is about three areas of production: resource conversion, product conversion, and marketing (or money conversion):

Facilyn: "Does this action address the weakest link in the chain of production?"

@fqwl_clarification
title: I need more clarification on weak links
tags: weak_links

Me: I need more clarification on weak links.

Facilyn: If ignored, weak links lead to repeated setbacks or failure. Social weak links involve resistance from people whose support you need. Biological weak links are critical when managing land, while financial weak links identify the bottleneck in your production chain.

A security robot patrols the street, diligently checking every door handle while completely missing the open window on the first floor — a perfect example of missing the real weak link.
