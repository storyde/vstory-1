title: Physical Resources
subtitle: Major Physical Assets Available to You

[? if part-of != "individual" : Facilyn: This framework requires everyone you just named to be involved in this conversation. So, this would normally be the moment you make sure everybody joins in. ?]

[? if sector = "policymaking" : Facilyn: And if your organisation is involved in governing and policymaking, you would also make sure to invite citizens from various backgrounds. Otherwise, you risk that your holistic context we are about to create reflects only the priorities of your organisation or of the institutions you collaborate with, instead of reflecting the interests of the people you govern. ?]

[? if part-of != "individual" : Facilyn: But given the approaching storm outside, we'll have to do that next time. ?]

Facilyn: Now we identify your major physical resources from which you can generate revenue or derive support. These resources need to be available to you, but you don't need to own them.

Me: Why identify rhysical resources?

Facilyn: Physical resources form the foundation of your operations. They represent your capacity to deliver services, produce goods, or create value. Understanding, what physical assets are available, helps you make better management decisions about how to use them effectively.

Facilyn: You may later decide to sell some of the assets you own, so you only need a general reminder of it.

A logistics robot rolls by, diligently cataloguing every object in sight — including a confused pigeon, now officially classified as "city’s air mail transport (unpaid intern)".
