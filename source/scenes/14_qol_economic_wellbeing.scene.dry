Me: I am not sure...

Facilyn: Take your time. Remember, you're describing how you want your economic life to feel and function, not specific dollar amounts or possessions.

Facilyn: Name what you gain from having money. Security? Freedom? The ability to help others? That underlying benefit is what belongs in your Quality of Life Statement.
