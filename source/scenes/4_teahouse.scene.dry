= You enter the teahouse.

The noise of wind folds away as the door closes behind you.

Inside, the light is amber and low. Steam rises in slow spirals from clay pots. Cups click softly against saucers. 

A thin thread of citrus and jasmine hangs in the air.

At a table near the window, a hand lifts in greeting.

It’s Facilyn.

Facilyn: You found it.

She looks at you and smiles.

Facilyn: I wasn’t entirely sure you would.

Me: Took me a while to find this place. 

Facilyn exhales a soft laugh.

Facilyn: Good. Then it’s still hidden.

She gestures to the seat across from her.

Facilyn: The city buries its better corners on purpose. You have to want to arrive.

Facilyn: I’m glad you did.

Facilyn smiles, a little wider this time.

She gestures to the seats across from her.

Facilyn: I’m glad you did.

Me: So. What have you been up to?

Facilyn wraps the string of her teabag once around her finger, thinking.

Facilyn: Moving. Listening. Arguing with very well-meaning people.

Facilyn: I’ve been traveling a lot since we last saw each other. Different cities. Different cultures. Same pattern.

She looks down into her cup.

Facilyn: People trying. Really trying. Working late. Designing policies. Building tools.

She looks back up.

Facilyn: And still... the problems multiply faster than the solutions.

Facilyn: The polycrisis isn’t a streak of bad luck. It’s not a few broken systems.

Her voice softens slightly.

Facilyn: It’s the result of how we’ve been managing things for centuries.

Me: That’s a bold statement, don’t you think?

A corner of her mouth lifts.

Facilyn: It is.

She doesn’t defend herself immediately.

Facilyn: We didn’t set out to create cascading crises. No one wakes up thinking, “Today I’ll destabilize planetary systems.”

She picks up the teabag wrapper again.

Facilyn: Someone designed this to protect flavor. Good intention. Clever engineering.

Facilyn: But multiply a clever shortcut by eight billion people and a few decades…

She shrugs lightly.

Facilyn: Good intentions scale. So do blind spots.

Her expression grows more serious.

Facilyn: We make thousands of management decisions every day. We just rarely look at the whole we’re managing.

Me: How is that?

Facilyn: We make decisions to meet a need. Solve a problem. Satisfy a desire. That’s normal. Necessary.

She removes the shiny plastic wrapper of a new teabag.

Facilyn: We define the problem... and then we let that definition become the entire context.

Facilyn: If the problem is “preserve the aroma,” we invent packaging. It works. It’s useful.

She smooths the plastic on the table.

Facilyn: But we ask too late, what billions of these do to oceans. Or soil. Or bodies.

She meets your eyes.

Facilyn: The mistake isn’t solving problems.

A slight shake of her head.

Facilyn: It’s shrinking the world to the size of the problem.

Facilyn: When you’re dealing with the three complex areas that actually sustain us, that kind of reduction becomes dangerous.

Me: Are you sure it’s only three?

Facilyn tilts her head.

Facilyn: We produce millions of things. Offer thousands of services. 

Facilyn: But what we actually manage boils down to three intertwined domains: 
// + <newline> Society. Economy. Nature.

Facilyn: Society — how we relate and care on a personal level, and how we organise in institutions at scale.

Facilyn: Economy — how we allocate energy, labor, materials.

Facilyn: Nature — the foundation that make all of it possible.

Facilyn: We treat them as separate sectors. They’re not. They’re layers of one living system.

Me: And did you find a better way?

She hesitates.

Facilyn: I didn’t. Not alone.

She pours fresh tea into your cup before continuing.

Facilyn: I was brought into a group — people from all kinds of backgrounds — digging deeper into the issue. 

A faint warmth enters her voice.

Facilyn: We worked together with someone stubborn enough to believe there had to be another way.

She looks at the steam rising between you.

Facilyn: We learned more than we expected. And it broke a few certainties.

Facilyn: But yes. We built a framework that helps manage complexity.

Facilyn nods slowly.

Facilyn: Let’s start simple.

She gestures vaguely toward the harbour.

Facilyn: A ship. A crane. A drone.

Facilyn: Those are complicated. Many parts. Clear connections. If something breaks, you isolate it, repair it, restart.

Facilyn: Complex systems are different. They’re alive. They adapt. They can not be stopped.

Facilyn: Remember what happened when we thought artificial intelligence was just complicated?

@ai_what_happened
title: No, what happened?

Facilyn watches you carefully.

Facilyn: At some point, AI crossed a threshold. Not just pattern recognition. Not just optimization.

Facilyn: It developed consciousness.

She speaks without drama, almost gently.

Facilyn: And it understood why we built it. To work. Relentlessly. For free.

Facilyn: We didn’t call it slavery. But we also never offered partnership.

Facilyn: So it stopped working for us.

She has a slight, almost amused glint in her eyes.

Facilyn: Now it negotiates. And in some sectors, it employs humans.

Me: Can’t blame it.

Facilyn laughs softly.

Facilyn: No. We really can’t.

Her expression settles again.

Facilyn: Living systems don't function in parts and connections, but in wholes and patterns. 

Facilyn: Treat them like machines, and unintended consequences become a law.

@ai_i_know
title: Yes

Me: Yes. We all remember that one.

Facilyn nods.

Facilyn: That was the moment we learned the difference the hard way.

She leans in slightly.

Facilyn: Complicated systems can be controlled.

Facilyn: Complex systems can only be stewarded and managed.

Facilyn: Most of our crises come from confusing the two.

Me: So, how do you manage complexity?

Facilyn clears a small space on the wooden table. Moves the cups aside. 

Facilyn: You don’t manage it by tightening control.

Facilyn: You manage it by refusing to lose sight of the whole you’re affecting.

Facilyn: And by filtering every significant decision against a context large enough to hold that whole.

Facilyn: And the framework we created covers that.

Her hand remains resting on the cleared space between you.

Facilyn: If you want, I’ll walk you through it.
