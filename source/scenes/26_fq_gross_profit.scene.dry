Me: I need help understanding this check.

Facilyn: The difference between the money you spend for an enterprise and the money you get out of it is the gross profit.

Facilyn: You are selecting the best enterprise or combination of enterprises to maximize profit while minimizing risk. This analysis takes a little longer than the other checks and requires pen and paper when evaluating new enterprises for your business.

Me: It contributes the most to covering overheads.

Facilyn: Excellent. You've identified this as a high-performing enterprise that will help sustain your business.

@fqgp_fail
title: It contributes little to covering overheads
on-arrival: fltr-profit = "contributes little"
go-to: 27_fq_energy_money
tags: gross_profit

Me: It contributes little to covering overheads.

Facilyn: You may want to reconsider if this is the best use of your resources, or if there are non-financial reasons that justify it.

@fqgp_combination
title: It is part of a good combination of enterprises
on-arrival: fltr-profit = "good combination"
go-to: 27_fq_energy_money
tags: gross_profit

Me: It is part of a good combination of enterprises.

Facilyn: Good. Sometimes a mix of enterprises creates the best stability and profit, even if one isn't the absolute highest earner on its own.
