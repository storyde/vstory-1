title: Gut Feel Check
subtitle: Values-Based Final Assessment
new-page: true

Facilyn: The gut feel check builds on the mental picture that has formed after passing through all the other checks. It asks about your feelings and effects on the greater whole:

Facilyn: "How do we feel about this action now? Will it lead to the quality of life we desire? Will it adversely affect the lives of others?"

Me: I need help understanding this check.

Facilyn: This check asks about your *intuition* rather than what you *think*. It connects directly to the values in your quality of life statement.

Facilyn: Even if an action passes all other checks, you might reject it if it doesn't feel right. Conversely, you might proceed with a flawed action if your gut says it's necessary, now knowing the negative consequences and aware you must mitigate the downsides.
