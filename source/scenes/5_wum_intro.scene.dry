Me: Yes, please

Facilyn sets down her tea, her eyes brightening.

Facilyn: Excellent! First we define the "whole" you're managing. This clarifies your resources and what you influence with your management. 

Facilyn: A manageable whole has three essential elements: The people who make decisions, the resources available to you, and the money you have or can generate.

Me: What do you mean with "whole"?

Facilyn: The idea of holism reminds us that the living world functions in integrated wholes and patterns, not so much as separate parts stitched together. Oxygen and hydrogen form something very different together, and studying them separately tells you very little about the nature of water.

Facilyn: When you define the whole you’re managing, you start to see how other wholes affect it — and how your choices ripple outward in return.
