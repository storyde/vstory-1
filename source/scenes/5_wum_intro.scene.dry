Me: Yes, please.

Facilyn places a pen and a sheet of thick paper on the table.

Facilyn: Whenever we try to “fix” something, we usually jump straight to the problem.

She smiles gently.

Facilyn: Let’s not do that.

She draws a slow circle on the paper.

Facilyn: We'll start with something simpler: Defining the whole you’re actually managing. 

Facilyn: Not the crisis. Not the symptom.

Facilyn: The whole.

She writes three words in the circle, leaving room between them:

Paper: People 

Paper: Resources 

Paper: Money

Facilyn: A manageable whole has these three essential elements.

She taps the pen next to the first word.

Facilyn: The people who make decisions. 

Her hand shifts.

Facilyn: The resources available to you. 

Then the last.

Facilyn: And the money you have — or can generate.

Facilyn: So before we talk about changing anything...

She nudges the pen a little closer to you.

Facilyn: What is the whole you’re managing?

Me: Why do we define the "whole"?

Facilyn: We’re trained to think in parts. Departments. Sectors. Issues.

Facilyn: But living systems don’t function that way.

She glances toward the steaming tea.

Facilyn: Oxygen alone isn’t water. Hydrogen alone isn’t water.

Facilyn: Studying them separately tells you almost nothing about what water *is*.

Facilyn: When you define your whole, you start to see two things: What actually influences it — and how your choices ripple outward in return.

Her finger moves outward beyond the circle.

Facilyn: Most management fails because we never define the whole. We manage fragments and hope they behave.

She taps the page lightly.

Facilyn: This is where we stop hoping.
