Me: Got it.

Facilyn: Let’s begin with the decision-makers.

Facilyn: For now, do you want to focus on just yourself?

Facilyn: Or should we expand the "whole" — include anyone you live with, decide with, or who has veto power over your decisions?

Me: Why involve everyone?

Facilyn: Leaving out affected parties risks conflict and makes the holistic context meaningless to those excluded.

A faint mechanical whirring passes outside.

Both of you glance toward the window.

A postal robot is attempting to deliver mail to a fire hydrant. It adjusts its angle. Retries. Waits politely, convinced the hydrant is a very quiet resident.

Facilyn watches it for a moment.

Facilyn: See?

Facilyn: The system thinks it has the right address. The hydrant disagrees.

She looks back at you.

Facilyn: Exclude a real stakeholder, and you end up negotiating with a fire hydrant.

Facilyn: Great. We will treat all of you together as the decision makers in your whole under management.

Me: Got it.

Facilyn: Let's start with the decision-makers. In your group, who is making decisions? Who is expected to carry out these decisions and are there any other people with veto power over your decisions? 

Facilyn: Try to be inclusive rather than exclusive.
