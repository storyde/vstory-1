= Frequently asked questions

**What is the Whole Under Management?**

The Whole Under Management is the “unit” you are managing and making decisions for. It is defined by three things:

Decision makers
Resource base
 Money

**Who counts as a decision maker?**

Anyone who makes day-to-day decisions, carries them out, or has veto power over them. Being inclusive prevents hidden constraints later.

**What is the resource base?**

Everything you rely on to support your quality of life and plans. It includes physical resources (land, buildings, equipment) and human resources (people, partners, customers, neighbours, communities).

**Why does “money” matter here?**

Because money is a real constraint and a real tool. It can come from savings, income, credit, or other sources available to your whole.

**What is a Holistic Context?**

Your Holistic Context is your shared “north star” for decision-making. It describes:

 The quality of life you want
 The future resource base needed to sustain it
[? if part-of = "org" : A statement of purpose for the organisation ?]

**What are the Filter Questions?**

They are the seven context checks that help you test any action against your holistic context, so you avoid solutions that look good today but create problems tomorrow.

The seven checks are:

 Cause and Effect
 Weak Link (social, biological, financial)
 Marginal Reaction
 Gross Profit Analysis
 Energy/Money Source and Use
 Sustainability
 Gut Feel

**What if an action fails a check?**

It does not automatically mean “never do it”. It means you have learned where the risk is. You can modify the action, choose a different action, or proceed knowing what you must monitor and control.

**Why is Gut Feel last?**

Because it uses the picture you built from the other checks. It asks how you feel about the action in terms of your values, relationships, and consequences for others.

**What are the “filter questions results”?**

They are a summary of your answers across the seven checks, to help you reflect on your decision and revisit anything you skipped.
