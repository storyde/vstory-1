<details>
  <summary>What is the Whole Under Management?</summary>
  <p>The Whole Under Management is the “unit” you are managing and making decisions for. It is defined by three things:<br>
    • Decision makers<br>
    • Resource base<br>
    • Money<br>
  </p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Who counts as a decision maker?</summary>
  <p>Anyone who makes day-to-day decisions, carries them out, or has veto power over them. Being inclusive prevents hidden constraints later.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is the resource base?</summary>
  <p>Everything you rely on to support your quality of life and plans. It includes physical resources (land, buildings, equipment) and human resources (people, partners, customers, neighbours, communities).</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is a Holistic Context?</summary>
  <p>Your Holistic Context is your shared “north star” for decision-making. It describes:<br>
    • The quality of life you want<br>
    • The future resource base needed to sustain it<br>
  </p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What else is included in a Holistic Context for organisations?</summary>
  <p>For organisations, the Holistic Context also includes a statement of purpose for the organisation.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What are the Filter Questions?</summary>
  <p>They are the seven context checks that help you test any action against your holistic context, so you avoid solutions that look good today but create problems tomorrow.</p>
  <p>The seven checks are: <br>
    • Cause and Effect<br>

    • Weak Link (social, biological, financial)<br>

    • Marginal Reaction<br>

    • Gross Profit Analysis<br>

    • Energy/Money Source and Use<br>

    • Sustainability<br>

    • Gut Feel<br>
    </p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>What if an action fails a check?</summary>
  <p>It does not automatically mean “never do it”. It means you have learned where the risk is. You can modify the action, choose a different action, or proceed knowing what you must monitor and control.</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>Why is Gut Feel last?</summary>
  <p>Because it uses the picture you built from the other checks. It asks how you feel about the action in terms of your values, relationships, and consequences for others.</p>
