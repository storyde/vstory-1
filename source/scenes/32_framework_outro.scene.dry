Me: Finalize my decision.

Facilyn: Congratulations! You've now experienced the complete Holistic Management framework. You've defined your whole, created your quality of life statement, described your future resource base, and learned to apply all seven context checks.

Facilyn: This framework will serve you well, use it wisely, share it generously, and remember that every decision is an opportunity to move toward the future you envision.

Facilyn: And remember, when managing complexity, conditions always change and what seems right today may still fail tomorrow — so begin by assuming you're wrong. Monitor your actions, correct and replan. This is doubly vital when your actions touch the land.

You and Facilyn talk quietly as the storm outside runs its course. When it finally settles, and you prepare to leave the teahouse, she looks up and says:

Facilyn: I really enjoyed our time together. But this is only the beginning. When we meet again, I’d love to explore how we might design a regenerative economy aligned with life — or even learn how to calm these dust storms.

Me: I need resources for continued learning.

Facilyn: The Savory Institute offers extensive resources, training programs, and a global community of practitioners. Local Holistic Management groups exist in many regions. Books, online courses, and workshops can deepen your understanding.

Facilyn: Most importantly, practice using the framework regularly. Start with small decisions and work up to larger ones as you become more comfortable with the process.

A librarian robot wheels by carrying a stack of books on sustainable systems, apparently on its way to update the teahouse's resource collection with the latest thinking on regenerative practices.
