Facilyn takes a long sip of her tea.

Facilyn: Now we come to the heart of it all — your Quality of Life Statement. This is no longer about what you already have, but how you want your life to be.

Facilyn: Think of it as your collective sense of what you most value.

Facilyn: We will start with economic well-being.

Me: Wait, can you explain a little further?

Facilyn: Of course. Your Quality of Life Statement should express why you're doing what you're doing, what you are about, and what you want to become. It's a reflection of what motivates and excites you.

Facilyn: We'll explore four key areas: Economic Well-Being, Relationships, Challenge and Growth, and Purpose and Contribution. Each area helps you articulate different aspects of how you want your life to be.
