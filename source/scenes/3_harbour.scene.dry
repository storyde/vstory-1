title: Harbour 

You reach the old harbour.

A delivery drone circles above the water, searching for the best angle for a selfie.  

In the hinterland, a dust storm is brewing, its grit already scratching at your throat.

On the quay, a vendor leans against his dented water tank, hoisting a cloudy glass and calling out:

Vendor: One sip for a coin. Or you keep walking thirsty.

You walk over to the tank. Faded posters hang from it, half covered in dust. 

You can still make out the headlines: 

Headline1: Harvests in the region down 70%. 

Headline2: Blackouts hit the outskirts. 

Headline3: The polycrisis is gaining momentum.

You hand over some crypto. The water tastes metallic, but it eases the scratching in your throat. 

The vendor cleans some glasses.

Me: Sorry, what exactly is a polycrisis? 

The vendor raises his eyebrows and gestures towards the harbour with his chin. 

Vendor: It used to be simple: first you had a power outtage, then maybe some protests. One after the other. 

He counts them off on his fingers. 

Vendor: Now the fields burn while the water is scarce, while prices shoot up, while people flee. And each of these things makes the others worse. 

He shrugs. 

Vendor: That's what they call a polycrisis. Many crises at once, feeding each other. 

For a moment he looks at you, weighing you up.  

Then he leans back against the tank.

Me: Can you tell me how to get to the teahouse?

Vendor: Follow the water until you reach the long pier with the small lighthouse at the end. You'll recognize the teahouse by the paper lanterns. They leave them out even in a storm. 

You thank him, follow his gaze along the water and set off. 

Between crates and moored boats, a child draws with a stick in the dust.

It's only a few lines, but you immediately recognize a small church, a school building, a rocket.

For a moment the wind holds its breath. 

Then a gust sweeps through the harbour and smears the lines until only grey dust remains. 

The child glances at the empty spot, sets the stick down again and starts drawing anew.

You walk along the quay. With every step, the shouts and engine noises grow quieter. 

You reach a long pier with a small lighthouse at the end of it, its beam lost over the water. 

At the start of the pier, an old warehouse rises up. 

Paper lanterns sway in the wind. Between them, wind chimes made from old teapots clink softly together. 

Next to the warehouse, a drone hovers in place, dropping crumbs to a swarm of eager pigeons. Then it falters, tips over and lies twitching on the ground.

You crouch and carefully pick it up.  

Me: Let's see... sensors misaligned.  

You switch off the drone, adjust its optics, check the battery and switch it back on again.  

It's display flickers: 

RoboDisplay: Thank you!

The drone lifts off, circling briefly before palling again with the birds. 

Something about its behaviour makes you smile...
