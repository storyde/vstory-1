Me: I need more clarification on this one.

Facilyn: Think about what energizes you and pushes you to grow. What sort of working environment stimulates creativity and allows you to reach your full potential? Focus on the conditions that bring out your best.

Facilyn: Challenge and growth aren't about stress or difficulty for their own sake - they're about engaging your capabilities fully and expanding them.
